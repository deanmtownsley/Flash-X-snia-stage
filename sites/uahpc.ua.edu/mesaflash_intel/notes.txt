I tried building mesa with the IntelCompilers setup, but the intel compiler appears too old
 -- mesa tries to use some floating point types or defines that don't work.
in building mtx file klu_src/klu_refactor.c (and probably others) many errors like:
----------------------------------
../klu_src/klu.h(143): error: identifier "__float128" is undefined
      __float128 *Rs ;
      ^
----------------------------------




Tried building with mesaflash using the IntelCompilers2016 setup

had to build hdf5 myself (no fortran bindings, which mesa needs)

the required mesa modules built fine

Flash compiled fine, but in final linking I get:

ld: MPIR_Thread: TLS definition in /share/apps/intel/2016//impi/4.1.3.048/intel64/lib/libmpi_mt.so section .tbss mismatches non-TLS definition in /share/apps/intel/2016//impi/4.1.3.048/intel64/lib/libmpi.so section .bss
/share/apps/intel/2016//impi/4.1.3.048/intel64/lib/libmpi_mt.so: could not read symbols: Bad value
make: *** [flash4] Error 1


This looks like an interal error in the mpi setup....
appears to be related to threading


a normal flash build with IntelCompilers2016 works without threading but not with
threading (tried +threadbl)


Try building with mesa SDK from 2016/1/29 gcc 5.3.1 (that was current at mesa release 9793)
That seems to work, though this is what Broxton had problems with before on
long runs
